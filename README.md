# Spool
Spool is a statically-typed, object-oriented programming language on a bytecode virtual machine inspired by the Java and Kotlin programming languages. It aims to provide things such as null safety and a better FFI for interfacing with native code.


Currently, it is far from production-ready and progress is currently going towards making a vm that can run a compiler for the language.
